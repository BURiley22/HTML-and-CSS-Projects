# HTML-and-CSS-Projects
A place for HTML &amp; CSS Projects done while studying at The Tech Academy

These projects were intended for those of us who are just beginning our software development journey.
They contain work that targeted specific actions learned; navbar, container, forms, headings, etc.

I am still in the early stages of my own development as is obvious if you take a look.

Onward from here!
